INTRO -

Hi Dave and Joyce, thank you again for doing this for me. I apologyze for the delay. I have attached the first page I
worked on. This is my friend and she is a photograoher. This is a portfolio page with modal galleries. I wanted to be 
responsive, so there is some code for that also. However, I do have a few question in trouble shootong my code.

QUESTIONS -

1. BROWSER COMPATABILYTY: When I uploaded the website to my server I came across some issues. My galleries seemed to 
look different in all the browsers. They also look different depending on the size of the monitor.

Safari - the images in the galleries look really small. It almost look as if the css is not being read properly. 
However, if I resize the browser window from big to small and then big again, the images become theactual size again.

Chrome - this seems to work in my 17inch. However, when I looked at it in my 15 inch, it looks different. The images
are jumpint down on the 3rd column of some of the galleries. 

Firefox - this one also seems to work pretty much perfect on the 17 inch but sometimes the images look small on the 13
inch one. Almost the same as the Safari glitch. 

Internet Explorer - modal doesn't work at all. None of the links are pulling the images. Also, when I click on the
thumbnail images, I get an ugly border around my link, is dotted and ugly. How do I get rid of that?

2. MODAL: I am having some issues with the modal window. When I click on an image to pull it big, the image that was
viewed before, comes up first. Then it switches the actual one after. I didn't modify any of the code from class on
the modal, just the css. I don't remember seeing this glitch on the modal from class, so this one I'm clueless on. I 
did some research on the internet but didn't find a solution. I also don't like how the pictures load from top to
buttom, but I guess that my be the format of the jpeg I'm using. I did save for web in photoshop and I think it was 
optimized. 

Anyway, this is what I have for this week. Once I fix this one I will upload the next stuff hopefully by wednesday 
next week.

Thanks again
